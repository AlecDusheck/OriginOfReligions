      <p>Buddhism was founded by relatively unknown philosopher from India. Buddhism is unlike most religious as most of their followers are divided of small groups. As Jean Przyluski puts it, "It was a religion without clergy and without monasteries; small groups leading a wondering life" (Przyluski 341).</p>
      <p>As Buddhism began to slowly grew in followers, albeit at a slow rate due to the unique properties of the religion.</p>

      <h3 class="secondary-page-header">AÅ›oka and the Maurya Empire</h3>
      <p>Buddhism is a very peaceful religion. It places a high emphasis on self-reflection and philosophy. However, it was adapted by empires, in particular, the Maurya Empire. </p>
      <p>The Kaurya Empire has a bloody history of conquests for more control and land. Before embracing Buddhism, Emperor AÅ›oka was aligned with these ideals. However, after becoming exposed to (and converting) to Buddhism, his perspective changed. AÅ›oka pushed the Buddhist religion through his empire and gave it significant influence.</p>
