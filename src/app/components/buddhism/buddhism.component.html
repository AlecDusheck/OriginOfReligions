      <h3 class="secondary-page-header">The origins of Buddhism</h3>
      <p>Buddhism was founded by relatively unknown philosopher from India. Buddhism is unlike most religious as most of their followers are divided of small groups. As Jean Przyluski puts it, "It was a religion without clergy and without monasteries; small groups leading a wondering life" (Przyluski 341).</p>
      <p>As Buddhism began to slowly grew in followers, albeit at a slow rate due to the unique properties of the religion.</p>

      <h3 class="secondary-page-header">AÅ›oka and the Maurya Empire</h3>
      <p>Buddhism is a very peaceful religion. It places a high emphasis on self-reflection and philosophy. However, it was adapted by empires, in particular, the Maurya Empire. </p>
      <p>The Kaurya Empire has a bloody history of conquests for more control and land. Before embracing Buddhism, Emperor AÅ›oka was aligned with these ideals. However, after becoming exposed to (and converting) to Buddhism, his perspective changed. AÅ›oka pushed the Buddhist religion through his empire and gave it significant influence (Joshua).</p>

      <p>The Kaurya Empire played a significant role in the further development of Buddhism, building multiple temples and giving the religion more exposure.</p>

      <h3 class="secondary-page-header">The Buddhist Temples <mdb-badge default="true">Primary Source</mdb-badge></h3>
      <p>Below is pictured the Sanchi Stupa, a famous Buddhist temple built by the Maurya Empire. The formation of these temples is perhaps the most obvious sign of the spread of Buddhism. </p>

      <p>Buddhist temples are incredibly complex and detailed. This temple in particular was personally commissioned by Emperor AÅ›oka. Worshippers, Monks, and Nuns would commonly congregate at this location to worship.</p>

      <p>The temples commonly had advanced carvings made of stone and ivory. These showed the dedication and effort put into these temples and carvings.</p>


      <h3 class="secondary-page-header">The Silk Road</h3>
      <p>Beyond the Maurya Empire, the most powerful spreading method of Buddhism was The Silk Road.</p>
      <p>Many traders on the Silk Road were indeed Buddhist (Liu 58). Due to the fact that the Silk Road connected both India and China, it served as the perfect channel on influence. As the number of Buddhist missionaries increased, Buddhism in China increased drastically.</p>
      <p>The influx of Buddhism into China also led to the building of Buddhist monasteries being built.</p>

      <h3 class="secondary-page-header">Conclusion ðŸŽ‰</h3>
      <p>Buddhism was primarily spread through trade routes. While the Kaurya Empire adapting Buddhism certainly served as an early catalyst, it was ultimately trade that spread and popularized Buddhism.</p>
      <p>As merchants and traders travelled down The Silk Road, they served as the primary method that Buddhism spread from India to China. It is safe to say that without The Silk Road, Buddhism probably would of stayed in India.</p>
